This system brought some light rain to the region, but the main impact was from the mid and high clouds ahead of the cold front. These clouds inhibited fog development, resulting in a mostly fog-free Thanksgiving Day morning. Dense fog returned the next morning, mainly over the east side of the San Joaquin Valley and persisting into the late morning hours. The dense night and morning fog became more widespread over the central and southern San Joaquin Valley from November 26th through the 28th as a stagnant weather pattern lingered over central California. \n",

       "A strong upper-level trough approached the central California interior on November 29th, destabilizing the airmass and reducing the San Joaquin Valley fog. A tight surface pressure gradient developed over California, resulting in northeast winds gusting over 60 mph across the Southern Sierra Nevada. High winds developed on November 30th which is a relatively rare phenomenon known as a Mono Wind Event across the Sierra Nevada. This event continued into the first two days of December and caused extensive tree damage across much of the Southern Sierra Nevada. Please see the December, 2011 storm data report for more details on this event.\n",

       "At the lower elevations, a cold front moved through the San Joaquin Valley on November 30th, bringing northwest winds gusting to near 50 mph. The front also triggered high winds over the Kern County deserts, with gusts between 55 to 75 mph across the Inyokern area. Local media reported roof damage to a home in Inyokern and some trees and powerlines downed. Mountain waves developed over the south end of the Sierra Nevada during the evening of November 30th.

This system brought some light rain to the region, but the main impact was from the mid and high clouds ahead of the cold front. These clouds inhibited fog development, resulting in a mostly fog-free Thanksgiving Day morning. Dense fog returned the next morning, mainly over the east side of the San Joaquin Valley and persisting into the late morning hours. The dense night and morning fog became more widespread over the central and southern San Joaquin Valley from November 26th through the 28th as a stagnant weather pattern lingered over central California. \n",

       "A strong upper-level trough approached the central California interior on November 29th, destabilizing the airmass and reducing the San Joaquin Valley fog. A tight surface pressure gradient developed over California, resulting in northeast winds gusting over 60 mph across the Southern Sierra Nevada. High winds developed on November 30th which is a relatively rare phenomenon known as a Mono Wind Event across the Sierra Nevada. This event continued into the first two days of December and caused extensive tree damage across much of the Southern Sierra Nevada. Please see the December, 2011 storm data report for more details on this event.\n",

       "At the lower elevations, a cold front moved through the San Joaquin Valley on November 30th, bringing northwest winds gusting to near 50 mph. The front also triggered high winds over the Kern County deserts, with gusts between 55 to 75 mph across the Inyokern area. Local media reported roof damage to a home in Inyokern and some trees and powerlines downed. Mountain waves developed over the south end of the Sierra Nevada during the evening of November 30th. One wave touched down near The Walker Pass, with the Blue Max weather station reporting a wind gust to 88 mph.EVENT NARRATIVE: </td><td>901689</td></tr>\n",

This system brought some light rain to the region, but the main impact was from the mid and high clouds ahead of the cold front. These clouds inhibited fog development, resulting in a mostly fog-free Thanksgiving Day morning. Dense fog returned the next morning, mainly over the east side of the San Joaquin Valley and persisting into the late morning hours. The dense night and morning fog became more widespread over the central and southern San Joaquin Valley from November 26th through the 28th as a stagnant weather pattern lingered over central California. \n",

       "A strong upper-level trough approached the central California interior on November 29th, destabilizing the airmass and reducing the San Joaquin Valley fog. A tight surface pressure gradient developed over California, resulting in northeast winds gusting over 60 mph across the Southern Sierra Nevada. High winds developed on November 30th which is a relatively rare phenomenon known as a Mono Wind Event across the Sierra Nevada. This event continued into the first two days of December and caused extensive tree damage across much of the Southern Sierra Nevada. Please see the December, 2011 storm data report for more details on this event.\n",

       "At the lower elevations, a cold front moved through the San Joaquin Valley on November 30th, bringing northwest winds gusting to near 50 mph. The front also triggered high winds over the Kern County deserts, with gusts between 55 to 75 mph across the Inyokern area.

Dense fog returned the next morning, mainly over the east side of the San Joaquin Valley and persisting into the late morning hours. The dense night and morning fog became more widespread over the central and southern San Joaquin Valley from November 26th through the 28th as a stagnant weather pattern lingered over central California. \n",

This system brought some light rain to the region, but the main impact was from the mid and high clouds ahead of the cold front. These clouds inhibited fog development, resulting in a mostly fog-free Thanksgiving Day morning. Dense fog returned the next morning, mainly over the east side of the San Joaquin Valley and persisting into the late morning hours. The dense night and morning fog became more widespread over the central and southern San Joaquin Valley from November 26th through the 28th as a stagnant weather pattern lingered over central California. \n",

       "A strong upper-level trough approached the central California interior on November 29th, destabilizing the airmass and reducing the San Joaquin Valley fog. A tight surface pressure gradient developed over California, resulting in northeast winds gusting over 60 mph across the Southern Sierra Nevada. High winds developed on November 30th which is a relatively rare phenomenon known as a Mono Wind Event across the Sierra Nevada. This event continued into the first two days of December and caused extensive tree damage across much of the Southern Sierra Nevada.

The front also triggered high winds over the Kern County deserts, with gusts between 55 to 75 mph across the Inyokern area. Local media reported roof damage to a home in Inyokern and some trees and powerlines downed. Mountain waves developed over the south end of the Sierra Nevada during the evening of November 30th.

This system brought some light rain to the region, but the main impact was from the mid and high clouds ahead of the cold front. These clouds inhibited fog development, resulting in a mostly fog-free Thanksgiving Day morning. Dense fog returned the next morning, mainly over the east side of the San Joaquin Valley and persisting into the late morning hours. The dense night and morning fog became more widespread over the central and southern San Joaquin Valley from November 26th through the 28th as a stagnant weather pattern lingered over central California. \n",

       "A strong upper-level trough approached the central California interior on November 29th, destabilizing the airmass and reducing the San Joaquin Valley fog. A tight surface pressure gradient developed over California, resulting in northeast winds gusting over 60 mph across the Southern Sierra Nevada. High winds developed on November 30th which is a relatively rare phenomenon known as a Mono Wind Event across the Sierra Nevada. This event continued into the first two days of December and caused extensive tree damage across much of the Southern Sierra Nevada.

This system brought some light rain to the region, but the main impact was from the mid and high clouds ahead of the cold front. These clouds inhibited fog development, resulting in a mostly fog-free Thanksgiving Day morning. Dense fog returned the next morning, mainly over the east side of the San Joaquin Valley and persisting into the late morning hours. The dense night and morning fog became more widespread over the central and southern San Joaquin Valley from November 26th through the 28th as a stagnant weather pattern lingered over central California. \n",

       "A strong upper-level trough approached the central California interior on November 29th, destabilizing the airmass and reducing the San Joaquin Valley fog. A tight surface pressure gradient developed over California, resulting in northeast winds gusting over 60 mph across the Southern Sierra Nevada. High winds developed on November 30th which is a relatively rare phenomenon known as a Mono Wind Event across the Sierra Nevada. This event continued into the first two days of December and caused extensive tree damage across much of the Southern Sierra Nevada. Please see the December, 2011 storm data report for more details on this event.\n",

       "At the lower elevations, a cold front moved through the San Joaquin Valley on November 30th, bringing northwest winds gusting to near 50 mph. The front also triggered high winds over the Kern County deserts, with gusts between 55 to 75 mph across the Inyokern area. Local media reported roof damage to a home in Inyokern and some trees and powerlines downed. Mountain waves developed over the south end of the Sierra Nevada during the evening of November 30th. One wave touched down near The Walker Pass, with the Blue Max weather station reporting a wind gust to 88 mph.EVENT NARRATIVE:  | 901504 |\n",

This system brought some light rain to the region, but the main impact was from the mid and high clouds ahead of the cold front. These clouds inhibited fog development, resulting in a mostly fog-free Thanksgiving Day morning. Dense fog returned the next morning, mainly over the east side of the San Joaquin Valley and persisting into the late morning hours. The dense night and morning fog became more widespread over the central and southern San Joaquin Valley from November 26th through the 28th as a stagnant weather pattern lingered over central California. \n",

       "A strong upper-level trough approached the central California interior on November 29th, destabilizing the airmass and reducing the San Joaquin Valley fog. A tight surface pressure gradient developed over California, resulting in northeast winds gusting over 60 mph across the Southern Sierra Nevada. High winds developed on November 30th which is a relatively rare phenomenon known as a Mono Wind Event across the Sierra Nevada. This event continued into the first two days of December and caused extensive tree damage across much of the Southern Sierra Nevada. Please see the December, 2011 storm data report for more details on this event.\n",

       "At the lower elevations, a cold front moved through the San Joaquin Valley on November 30th, bringing northwest winds gusting to near 50 mph. The front also triggered high winds over the Kern County deserts, with gusts between 55 to 75 mph across the Inyokern area. Local media reported roof damage to a home in Inyokern and some trees and powerlines downed. Mountain waves developed over the south end of the Sierra Nevada during the evening of November 30th. One wave touched down near The Walker Pass, with the Blue Max weather station reporting a wind gust to 88 mph.EVENT NARRATIVE:  | 901689 |\n",

This system brought some light rain to the region, but the main impact was from the mid and high clouds ahead of the cold front. These clouds inhibited fog development, resulting in a mostly fog-free Thanksgiving Day morning. Dense fog returned the next morning, mainly over the east side of the San Joaquin Valley and persisting into the late morning hours. The dense night and morning fog became more widespread over the central and southern San Joaquin Valley from November 26th through the 28th as a stagnant weather pattern lingered over central California. \n",

       "A strong upper-level trough approached the central California interior on November 29th, destabilizing the airmass and reducing the San Joaquin Valley fog. A tight surface pressure gradient developed over California, resulting in northeast winds gusting over 60 mph across the Southern Sierra Nevada. High winds developed on November 30th which is a relatively rare phenomenon known as a Mono Wind Event across the Sierra Nevada. This event continued into the first two days of December and caused extensive tree damage across much of the Southern Sierra Nevada. Please see the December, 2011 storm data report for more details on this event.\n",

       "At the lower elevations, a cold front moved through the San Joaquin Valley on November 30th, bringing northwest winds gusting to near 50 mph. The front also triggered high winds over the Kern County deserts, with gusts between 55 to 75 mph across the Inyokern area.

       "13 EPISODE NARRATIVE: A low pressure trough moved into California on November 24th. This system brought some light rain to the region, but the main impact was from the mid and high clouds ahead of the cold front. These clouds inhibited fog development, resulting in a mostly fog-free Thanksgiving Day morning. Dense fog returned the next morning, mainly over the east side of the San Joaquin Valley and persisting into the late morning hours. The dense night and morning fog became more widespread over the central and southern San Joaquin Valley from November 26th through the 28th as a stagnant weather pattern lingered over central California. \\n\\nA strong upper-level trough approached the central California interior on November 29th, destabilizing the airmass and reducing the San Joaquin Valley fog. A tight surface pressure gradient developed over California, resulting in northeast winds gusting over 60 mph across the Southern Sierra Nevada. High winds developed on November 30th which is a relatively rare phenomenon known as a Mono Wind Event across the Sierra Nevada. This event continued into the first two days of December and caused extensive tree damage across much of the Southern Sierra Nevada. Please see the December, 2011 storm data report for more details on this event.\\n\\nAt the lower elevations, a cold front moved through the San Joaquin Valley on November 30th, bringing northwest winds gusting to near 50 mph. The front also triggered high winds over the Kern County deserts, with gusts between 55 to 75 mph across the Inyokern area. Local media reported roof damage to a home in Inyokern and some trees and powerlines downed. Mountain waves developed over the south end of the Sierra Nevada during the evening of November 30th. One wave touched down near The Walker Pass, with the Blue Max weather station reporting a wind gust to 88 mph.EVENT NARRATIVE: \n",

       "20 EPISODE NARRATIVE: A low pressure trough moved into California on November 24th. This system brought some light rain to the region, but the main impact was from the mid and high clouds ahead of the cold front. These clouds inhibited fog development, resulting in a mostly fog-free Thanksgiving Day morning. Dense fog returned the next morning, mainly over the east side of the San Joaquin Valley and persisting into the late morning hours. The dense night and morning fog became more widespread over the central and southern San Joaquin Valley from November 26th through the 28th as a stagnant weather pattern lingered over central California. \\n\\nA strong upper-level trough approached the central California interior on November 29th, destabilizing the airmass and reducing the San Joaquin Valley fog. A tight surface pressure gradient developed over California, resulting in northeast winds gusting over 60 mph across the Southern Sierra Nevada. High winds developed on November 30th which is a relatively rare phenomenon known as a Mono Wind Event across the Sierra Nevada. This event continued into the first two days of December and caused extensive tree damage across much of the Southern Sierra Nevada. Please see the December, 2011 storm data report for more details on this event.\\n\\nAt the lower elevations, a cold front moved through the San Joaquin Valley on November 30th, bringing northwest winds gusting to near 50 mph. The front also triggered high winds over the Kern County deserts, with gusts between 55 to 75 mph across the Inyokern area. Local media reported roof damage to a home in Inyokern and some trees and powerlines downed. Mountain waves developed over the south end of the Sierra Nevada during the evening of November 30th. One wave touched down near The Walker Pass, with the Blue Max weather station reporting a wind gust to 88 mph.EVENT NARRATIVE: \n",

       "30 EPISODE NARRATIVE: A low pressure trough moved into California on November 24th. This system brought some light rain to the region, but the main impact was from the mid and high clouds ahead of the cold front. These clouds inhibited fog development, resulting in a mostly fog-free Thanksgiving Day morning. Dense fog returned the next morning, mainly over the east side of the San Joaquin Valley and persisting into the late morning hours. The dense night and morning fog became more widespread over the central and southern San Joaquin Valley from November 26th through the 28th as a stagnant weather pattern lingered over central California. \\n\\nA strong upper-level trough approached the central California interior on November 29th, destabilizing the airmass and reducing the San Joaquin Valley fog. A tight surface pressure gradient developed over California, resulting in northeast winds gusting over 60 mph across the Southern Sierra Nevada. High winds developed on November 30th which is a relatively rare phenomenon known as a Mono Wind Event across the Sierra Nevada. This event continued into the first two days of December and caused extensive tree damage across much of the Southern Sierra Nevada. Please see the December, 2011 storm data report for more details on this event.\\n\\nAt the lower elevations, a cold front moved through the San Joaquin Valley on November 30th, bringing northwest winds gusting to near 50 mph. The front also triggered high winds over the Kern County deserts, with gusts between 55 to 75 mph across the Inyokern area. Local media reported roof damage to a home in Inyokern and some trees and powerlines downed. Mountain waves developed over the south end of the Sierra Nevada during the evening of November 30th. One wave touched down near The Walker Pass, with the Blue Max weather station reporting a wind gust to 88 mph.EVENT NARRATIVE: \n",
